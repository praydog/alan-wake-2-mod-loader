# alan-wake-2-mod-loader

A mod loader for Alan Wake 2 that enables easy installation of mods by allowing modded files to be loaded directly from the Windows filesystem, rather than big packaged files.

## Installation

Extract the zip on the [Releases](https://github.com/praydog/alan-wake-2-mod-loader/releases/) page into your AlanWake2 directory.

## Installation of loose file mods

Can usually just extract any mod into the game directory with its original RMDTOC folder structure.

## Limitations

Unknown at this time. Tested on a few mods but not aware of any issues yet.
